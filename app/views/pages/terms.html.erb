            <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>

                 <h3>10. Arbitration</h3>
                     
            <p>For any dispute you have with MarlaKnows, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If MarlaKnows has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and MarlaKnows agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that MarlaKnows will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND MarlaKnows ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>          
       
            <h3>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
          
          
            
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Diego County, California or the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, for any actions not subject to Section 10 (Arbitration).</p>
          
            
            <p>Our Products are controlled and operated from the United States, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>
          
                   <h3>12. General Terms</h3>

            <p><em>Assignment.</em>  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by MarlaKnows without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
          
            
            <p><em>Entire Agreement/Severability.</em>  These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with MarlaKnows in connection with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and MarlaKnows concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
          
            
            <p><em>No Waiver.</em>  No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and MarlaKnows's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
